Java Jukebox - Java based player for mp3 library

This is a standalone music player intended for use in shared work environments, but works just as well as a personal player as well.

This player uses the BasicPlayer API from JavaZoom. (http://www.javazoom.net/jlgui/api.html). The java process lauches an embedded Jetty server to provide a web interface and webservice endpoints. There is a companion Android application (JavaJukeboxApp) that interfaces with the process to provide remote control features via mobile device.

This project is built and packaged using Maven 2.
Run "mvn clean package" from the root directory to build and package the assembly zip file.
Expand the zip file to a location of your choice.
Run the appropriate script from the bin directory to start the app

Example:
./jukebox.sh -p <port> -d <directory>
where <port> is the web interface port
  and <directory> is the root path of where your mp3 files are stored.
  
This has been tested using Java6 on Windows XP and Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
